                    <p>Aspiring Software Developer in my fourth year of computing science at the University of Alberta.
                        <br> <br>

                        Here are a few examples of my work: <br><br>

                        ✅ Worked as a developer for Zero RampUp as part of a team and created a fully functional website
                        using JavaScript. <br>
                        ✅ Developed and tested an Android social media app as a developer in a Scrum environment.<br>
                        ✅ Trained in machine learning and deep-learning-based machine vision methods: customized and
                        developed models for object detection. <br><br>

                        𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀 & 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀: React, Python, Java, Android, PostgreSQL, MongoDB,
                        Docker & AI technologies! <br><br>

                        I get excited about opportunities where I’m able to work with highly creative people to develop
                        innovative solutions using the latest technology.

                        • Conducted a 6-week research project, in collaboration with an intern and a team of graduate
                        students, to optimize the performance of a program that simulates the boardgame Hex, mainly
                        through refactoring and rewriting existing code.
                        • Implemented and learned Python and graph search algorithms at a rapid pace to participate in
                        the program.
                        • Presented the results of the research to a 30+ person audience and answered questions.
                        • Achieved duties 1 week ahead of the deadline and took initiative to advise another team.
